## Abstract
Streamflow response during baseflow conditions is a function of storage and outflow, but it is also known that this functional relationship varies among catchments and seasons. Traditionally, hydrological models incorporate conceptual groundwater reservoirs consisting of linear or non-linear storage-outflow functions. Identification of the right model structure and model parameterization however is challenging particularly for models with a high degree of complexity. 

### Aim
The aim of this contribution was to systematically test different parsimonious model structures in a set of catchments where different aquifer types govern streamflow response during baseflow conditions.
